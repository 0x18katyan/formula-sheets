## Description
Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

## Courses
1. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces.
2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models.
3. Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models.
4. Natural Language Processing with Attention Models.
