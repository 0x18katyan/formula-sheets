# Coursera Natural Language Processing Specialization - deeplearning.ai

[Natural Language Processing - Formula Sheet](./fady-morris_natural-language-processing.pdf)

## Description
Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

Use logistic regression, naÃ¯ve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words.

Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to implement autocorrect, autocomplete & identify part-of-speech tags for words.

Use recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs & Siamese networks for sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition.

Use encoder-decoder, causal, & self-attention to machine translate complete sentences, summarize text, build chatbots & question-answering.
