# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization - deeplearning.ai

[Deep Learning - Formula Sheet](./fady-morris_deep-learning.pdf)

## Description
In five courses, you learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow.

## Courses
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning.
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks.
5. Sequence Models.
